#Flight-Fare-Prediction#

Scraped Python 3.10 Scikit-learn Flask

Airfare prices are highly dynamic and influenced by multiple factors such as departure time, booking window, airline, route, and seasonality. Predicting these prices accurately can help travelers secure the best fares and assist airlines in optimizing pricing strategies. This project utilizes historical flight data to develop a machine learning-based flight price prediction model. Pyspark and PySQL are used for data preprocessing which includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling. Python and machine learning are used for data modeling. Tableau is used as data visualization tool for presenting data interactively. Feature engineering techniques are employed to extract valuable insights, such as time-based patterns and fare trends. Different machine learning models are trained to predict ticket prices, with hyperparameter tuning applied for optimization. Model performance is evaluated using metrics like mean absolute error(MAE),mean squared error(MSE) and R-square score
